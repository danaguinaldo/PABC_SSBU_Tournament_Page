                Philippine-American Baptist Church is hosting a local tournament to support our youth group to go to Camp Fusion.
                This tournament is a fundraiser for our youth members to return to a baptist camp called Camp Fusion. 
                Camp Fusion is a baptist youth camp that our members go to every year to learn more about Jesus and experience faith in a 
                Christian environment. If you have any questions or concerns about Camp Fusion click on the link above to learn more, or contact us
                by checking the contacts tab at the top and finding a representative to speak to.

                        April 6, 2019 is when the date the tournament is held. Registration will open 9:00AM CST and like we stated above,  
                        walk-in registration will be welcomed. If you are registered online a spot will be reserved for you and just let us know
                        at the door that you are registered. In the event that you are not present at the end of registration at 9:50 AM CST, and you
                        are registered online, your spot will be forfeited to a player already present and paid for unless you give us a reason 
                        for tardiness prior to end of registration. <br> <br>
                        At 10:00 AM CST we will begin our introduction ceremony with a short 15 minute devotional, and house-keeping rules. <br> <br>
                        At 11:00 AM CST the tournament will officially start and players have 5 minutes to arrive at their stations otherwise you
                        will forefeit the set.
